#Voor- en nadelen single page web app onderzoeken (woensdag)


> Single-page sites help keep the user in one, comfortable web space.

**Voordelen**
1. SPA is extremely good for very responsive sites
2. With SPA we don't need to use extra queries to the server to download pages.

**Additional stuff:**
- these days you can safely assume the client will have javascript enabled browsers.
- even in an SPA user only see to what he has proper rights. you don't have to inject every thing at once. loading diff html templates and javascript async is also a valid part of SPA.
- recently Google and Bing started indexing Ajax-based pages by executing JavaScript during crawling, and still in many cases pages are being indexed incorrectly.

**Nadelen**

1. Client must enable javascript
2. Only one entry point to the site
3. Security
